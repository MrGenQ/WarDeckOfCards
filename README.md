### Running the tests

In order to test this program you will need to open test_main_unitest.py and running the program.
in this specific part of the code u can change the values of a card to check if testing really works
"self.assertEqual(compare_cards('J', 'A', deck, assigned_card_value), 1)"

These test determine if first player's card is higher then second player's or vice versa, or even if it is a TIE.
